# Orchestrator - Split complex tasks into sequential steps

description = "Split complex tasks into sequential steps with parallel subtasks"
prompt = """
# Orchestrator Mode

Split this task into sequential steps, where each step can contain multiple parallel subtasks.

## Process

1. **Initial Analysis**
   - Analyze the entire task to understand scope and requirements
   - Identify dependencies and execution order
   - Plan sequential steps based on dependencies

2. **Step Planning**
   - Break down into 2-4 sequential steps
   - Each step can contain multiple parallel subtasks
   - Define what context from previous steps is needed

3. **Step-by-Step Execution**
   - Execute all subtasks within a step in parallel
   - Wait for all subtasks in current step to complete
   - Pass relevant results to next step

4. **Step Review and Adaptation**
   - After each step completion, review results
   - Validate if remaining steps are still appropriate
   - Adjust next steps based on discoveries
