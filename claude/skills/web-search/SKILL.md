## X (Twitter) Usage

### Search Query

WebSearch: "site:x.com {topic} {keyword}"
```

### ⚠️ Verification Required (CRITICAL)
X content MUST be verified:
1. **Account credibility** - Official or known expert?
2. **Cross-reference** - Verify with official docs
3. **Date check** - Is it current?
4. **Read replies** - Any corrections?

```
X claim → Official docs → Cross-reference → Confirm or reject
